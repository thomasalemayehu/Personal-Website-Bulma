        <p class="title has-text-centered">Exercise and Productivity</p>
        <p class="mb-5 is-size-6-mobile is-size-5-desktop">
          We all know exercise keeps you healthy but exercising can also
          increase productivity in all areas of your life. Not only does
          exercise give you more energy and stop that afternoon fatigue slump,
          exercise keeps momentum and it improves mental capacity. In theory,
          exercise helps with ‘brain fog’.Exercise is shown to reduce stress,
          combat fatigue, improve performance and lead to fewer workday
          absences. A natural stress reducer, exercise combats chronic stress
          often suffered by workers. With exercise your sleep quality also
          improves, thus, you wake rested and ready to tackle another day.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-5 is-size-6-mobile is-size-5-desktop">
          Moreover, exercise increases your energy capacity, every time you
          exercise and push your limits, your body recovers and your energy
          capacity is increased. Exercise ensures proper brain function in the
          hippocampus region. Not only does exercise keep blood, glucose and
          oxygen levels high, feeding the brain, it releases endorphins into the
          body giving your mood a boost. Aerobic exercise is shown to change the
          size of the area of the brain involved in memory and learning.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-5 is-size-6-mobile is-size-5-desktop">
          Busy working professionals find it hard to fit exercise into their
          hectic schedules, but taking time for exercise actually increases
          mental acuity. Exercise truly feeds the brain, essential if you’re
          going to be more effective and efficient. When your brain is
          performing at full capacity, you focus better, concentrate more, and
          thus make smarter decisions.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-5 is-size-6-mobile is-size-5-desktop">
          More and more companies are allowing employees to take exercise at
          work. Big giants like Google led the way with in-office gyms and Nike
          have in-office yoga classes for their employees. Companies are
          noticing the benefits exercise has on employee productivity. Studies
          of office workers who regularly exercise found that long sitting time
          at work was linked to a lower work productivity and decreased mental
          well-being. Employers have taken to implementing ‘sit less, move more’
          interventions such as standing desks and offering employees time for
          exercise during working hours to improve work productivity.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-5 is-size-6-mobile is-size-5-desktop">
          Intelligent physical exercise training (IPET) at work was studied in
          Denmark with a range of occupations including dentists, office and
          computer workers and healthcare workers. The results showed in all
          jobs participants improved cardio respiratory health and muscle
          strength, these health improvements, in turn, saw increased
          productivity and fewer lost work days through illness.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-5 is-size-6-mobile is-size-5-desktop">
          Your boss might not offer this holistic approach, or if you want to do
          more exercise out of work hours, knowing which exercises are best for
          increasing work production is key. <br />
          Now we look at which type of exercise is scientifically proven to
          increase productivity and creativity.
        </p>

        <p class="title is-4">Walking</p>
        <p class="mb-5 is-size-6-mobile is-size-5-desktop">
          Yes, simply walking as exercise gets those creative juices flowing. In
          fact, one study shows that when walking and after creativity was
          increased, with some participants up to 81 percent. Another study
          showed that a lunchtime walk for 30 minutes helps battle that
          afternoon slump and the need to reach for the caffeine pick me up.
          Participants felt less stressed, less fatigued and were more alert,
          enabling them to easily cope with the workload. Walking to work or a
          lunchtime stroll is a cheap form of exercise that raises your heart
          rate and is easy to fit into your schedule. Indoors on a treadmill or
          outdoors walking are both beneficial to increasing your productivity.
        </p>

        <p class="title is-4">Recall a memory from long ago</p>
        <p class="mb-5 is-size-6-mobile is-size-5-desktop">
          Reach for familiar music, especially if it stems from the same time
          period that you are trying to recall. Listening to the Beatles might
          bring you back to the first moment you laid eyes on your spouse, for
          instance.
        </p>

        <p class="title is-4">Yoga</p>
        <p class="mb-5 is-size-6-mobile is-size-5-desktop">
          Yoga’s principle teachings help to improve production. Studies have
          shown the positive effects of practicing yoga on self-esteem and
          motivation, in turn, increases a person’s ability to cope with stress
          load. Increased creativity, ability to problem-solve and higher energy
          levels were seen by participants.
